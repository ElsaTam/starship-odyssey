# Lotus (substance)

NEEDS REVISION
- Think about revising human only-quarter details.

NEEDS MORE DETAIL
- Add detail that Health & Wellness Committee discourages use and publishes propaganda.
- Add detail that many people who advice conforming to the cultural stands of the [[Interspecies Committee]] use lotus to feel authentic and free.

## Overview

**Lotus** is a drug used by a significant portion of the human population aboard the Odyssey. Its effects vary among individuals, similar to substances like alcohol or hallucinogens on Earth. Itâ€™s general impact is calming.

## **Dosage And Consumption**

Lotus doses are typically measured in "petals" or "flowers." Lotus is said to be an alien plant and it is brewed into a tea.

## **Effects**

While Lotus generally has a calming effect, it can also lead to different experiences, including mild hallucinations or altered states of consciousness. It's casually used by many aboard the Odyssey, much like how some might enjoy a glass of wine or beer in the evening.

## **Misuse And Overdose**

Excessive consumption of Lotus can lead to extreme apathy. People affected in this way, often referred to as "Lotuseaters," become so despondent and nihilistic that they neglect basic self-care, refusing to eat, drink, or even move. Without medical intervention, this can lead to death.

## **Societal Perception and Regulation**

The [[Muses' Collective]] has been known to blame violence or rogue behavior on Lotus use. They have launched various campaigns highlighting the damaging effects of Lotus consumption, especially among younger individuals.

For adults, Lotus use is generally seen as a matter of personal responsibility.

Among the elite and influential, the 'purity' of the Lotus they consume can serve as a status symbol.

## **Human-Only Quarter's Perception**

In the human-only quarter of the Odyssey, where authenticity is valued over performativity, Lotus is seen as unnecessary and superficial. This contrasts with the broader population's view, where its use is more accepted and integrated into daily life.
