On a 7-9, you flinch, hesitate, or stall: the MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. ATTACK SOMEONE When you attack someone unprepared, unsuspecting, or helpless, roll+hard. Ona 10+, inflict full harm as established. On a 7-9, they're able somehow to dodge, block, or duck, or else you just don't quite strike home; inflict little harm. In either case, if they can and do choose to fight back, now you're doing battle with them. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. 10 BATILE When you do battle with someone, choose the appropriate extended battle â€˜moves with the MC, and see them through. GO AGGRO When you go aggro on someone, say what you want them to do, and say what you'll do if they don't. Rollshard. On a 10+, they have to choose: force your hand, or cave and do what you want. If they force your hand, you can do what you threatened, including inflicting harm as established. On a 7-9, they can choose to force your hand o to cave, but they can also choose instead to fight back or make a break for it, and now you're doing battle with them. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. SEDUCE OR MANIPULATE When you try to seduce or manipulate someone, tell them what you want and roll+hot. For NPCs: on a hit, they ask you to promise something first, and do it if you promise. On a 10+, whether you keep your promise is up to you, later. On a 7-9, they need some concrete assurance right now. For PCs: on a 10+, both. Ona 7-9, choose 1: + ifthey doit, they mark experience if they refuse, erase one of their stat highlights for the remainder of the session What they do then is up to them. On amiss, for either NPCs or PCs, be prepared for the worst.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
