{"path":"Starship Odyssey/09 - Creator Notes/Resources/Apocalypse World Playbooks & GM Guidelines.pdf","text":"THE ANGEL Print pages 5–6 When you’re lying in the dust of Apocalypse World guts aspilled, for whom do you pray? e gods? ey’re long gone. Your beloved comrades? Fuckers all, or you wouldn’t be here to begin with. Your precious old mother? She’s a darling but she can’t put an intestine back inside so it’ll stay. No, you pray for some grinning kid or veteran or just someone with a heartshocker and a hand with sutures and a 6-pack of morphine. And when that someone comes, that’s an angel. Angels are medics. If you want everybody to love you, or at least rely on you, play an angel. Warning: if things are going well, maybe nobody will rely on you. Make interesting relationships so you’ll stay relevant. Or sabotage things, I guess. THE BATTLEBABE Print pages 7–8 Even in a place as dangerous as Apocalypse World, battlebabes are, well. ey’re the ones you should walk away from, eyes down, but you can’t. ey’re the ones like the seductive blue crackling light, y’know? You mistake looking at them for falling in love, and you get too close and it’s a zillion volts and your wings burn off like paper. Dangerous. Battlebabes are good in battle, of course, but they’re wicked social too. If you want to play somebody dangerous and provocative, play a battlebabe. Warning: you might �nd that you’re better at making trouble than getting out of it. If you want to play the baddest ass, play a gunlugger instead. THE BRAINER Print pages 9–10 Brainers are the weird psycho psychic mindfucks of Apocalypse World. ey have brain control, puppet strings, creepy hearts, dead souls, and eyes like broken things. ey stand in your peripheral vision and whisper into your head, staring. ey clamp lenses over your eyes and read your secrets. ey’re just the sort of tasteful accoutrement that no well-appointed hardhold can do without. Brainers are spooky, weird, and really fun to play. eir moves are powerful but strange. If you want everybody else to be at least a little bit afraid of you, a brainer is a good choice. Warning: you’ll be happy anyway, but you’ll be happiest if somebody wants to have sex with you even though you’re a brainer. Angle for that if you can. APOCALYPSE WORLD Nobody remembers how or why. Maybe nobody ever knew. e oldest living survivors have childhood memories of it: cities burning, society in chaos then collapse, families set to panicked �ight, the weird nights when the smoldering sky made midnight into a blood-colored half-day. Now the world is not what it was. Look around you: evidently, certainly, not what it was. But also close your eyes, open your brain: something is wrong. At the limits of perception, something howling, everpresent, full of hate and terror. From this, the world’s psychic maelstrom, we none of us have shelter. APOCALYPSE WORLD PLAYER REFBOOK 2nd Edition. ©2016 by D. Vincent Baker & Meguey Baker is �le contains the 11 basic character playbooks and the complete set of player reference sheets. THE CHOPPER Print pages 11–12 Apocalypse World is all scarcity, of course it is. ere’s not enough wholesome food, not enough untainted water, not enough security, not enough light, not enough electricity, not enough children, not enough hope. However, the Golden Age Past did leave us two things: enough gasoline, enough bullets. Come the end, I guess the fuckers didn’t need them like they thought they would. So chopper, there you are. Enough for you. Choppers lead biker gangs. ey’re powerful but lots of their power is external, in their gang. If you want weight to throw around, play a chopper—but if you want to be really in charge, play a hardholder instead. Warning: externalizing your power means drama. Expect drama. THE DRIVER Print pages 13–14 Came the apocalypse, and the infrastructure of the Golden Age tore apart. Roads heaved and split. Lines of life and communication shattered. Cities, cut off from one another, raged like smashed anthills, then burned, then fell. A few living still remember it: every horizon scorching hot with civilization in �ames, light to put out the stars and moon, smoke to put out the sun. In Apocalypse World the horizons are dark, and no roads go to them. Drivers have cars, meaning mobility, freedom, and places to go. If you can’t see the post-apocalypse without cars, you gotta be a driver. Warning: your loose ties can accidentally keep you out of the action. Commit to the other characters to stay in play. THE GUNLUGGER Print pages 15–16 Apocalypse World is a mean, ugly, violent place. Law and society have broken down completely. What’s yours is yours only while you can hold it in your hands. ere’s no peace. ere’s no stability but what you carve, inch by inch, out of the concrete and dirt, and then defend with murder and blood. Sometimes the obvious move is the right one. Gunluggers are the baddest asses. eir moves are simple, direct and violent. Crude, even. If you want to take no shit, play a gunlugger. Warning: like angels, if things are going well, you might be kicking your heels. Interesting relation- ships can keep you in the scene. THE HARDHOLDER Print pages 17–18 ere is no government, no society, in Apocalypse World. When hardholders ruled whole continents, when they waged war on the other side of the world instead of with the hold across the burn-�at, when their armies numbered in the hundreds of thousands and they had fucking boats to hold their fucking airplanes on, that was the golden age of legend. Now, anyone with a concrete compound and a gang of gunluggers can claim the title. You, you got something to say about it? Hardholders are landlords, warlords, governors of their own little strongholds. If anybody plays a hardholder, the game’s going to have a serious and immobile home base. If you want to be the one who owns it, it better be you. Warning: don’t be a hardholder unless you want the burdens. THE HOCUS Print pages 19–20 Now it should be crystal fucking obvious that the gods have abandoned Apocalypse World. Maybe in the golden age, with its one nation under god and its in god we trust, maybe then the gods were real. Fucked if I know. All I know is that now they’re gone daddy gone. My theory is that these weird hocus fuckers, when they say “the gods,” what they really mean is the miasma left over from the explosion of psychic hate and desperation that gave Apocalypse World its birth. Friends, that’s our creator now. Hocuses have cult followers the way choppers have gangs. ey’re strange, social, public and compelling. If you want to sway mobs, play a hocus. Warning: things are going to come looking for you. Being a cult leader means having to deal with your fucking cult. THE MAESTRO D’ Print pages 21–22 In the golden age of legend, there was this guy named Maestro. He was known for dressing up real dap and whever he went, the people had much luxe tune. ere was this other guy named Maitre d’. He was known for dressing up real dap and whever he went, the people had all the food they could eat and the fanciest of it. Here in Apocalypse World, those two guys are dead. ey died and the fat sizzled off them, they died same as much-luxe-tune and all-you-can-eat. e maestro d’ now, he can’t give you what those guys used to could, but fuck it, maybe he can �nd you a little somethin somethin to take off the edge. e maestro d’ runs a social establishment, like a bar, a drug den or a bordello. If you want to be sexier than a hardholder, with fewer obligations and less shit to deal with, play a maestro d’. Warning: fewer obligations and less shit, not none and none. THE SAVVYHEAD Print pages 23–24 If there’s one fucking thing you can count on in Apocalypse World, it’s: things break. Savvyheads are techies. ey have really cool abilities in the form of their workspace, and a couple of fun reality-bending moves. Play a savvyhead if you want to be powerful and useful as an ally, but maybe not the leader yourself. Warning: your workspace depends on resources, and lots of them, so make friends with everyone you can. THE SKINNER Print pages 25–26 Even in the �lth of Apocalypse World, there’s food that isn’t death on a spit, music that isn’t shrieking hyenas, thoughts that aren’t afraid, bodies that aren’t used meat, sex that isn’t rutting, dancing that’s real. ere are moments that are more than stench, smoke, rage and blood. Anything beautiful left in this ugly ass world, skinners hold it. Will they share it with you? What do you offer them? Skinners are pure hot. ey’re entirely social and they have great, directly manipulative moves. Play a skinner if you want to be unignorable. Warning: skinners have the tools, but unlike hardholders, choppers and hocuses, they don’t have a steady in�ux of motivation. You’ll have most fun if you can roll your own.

In�rmary: you get an in�rmary, a workspace with life support, a drug lab and a crew of 2 (Shigusa & Mox, maybe). Get patients into it and you can work on them like a savvyhead on tech (cf ). Professional compassion: you can roll+sharp instead of roll+Hx when you help someone who’s rolling. Battle�eld grace: while you are caring for people, not �ghting, you get +1armor. Healing touch: when you put your hands skin-to-skin on a wounded person and open your brain to them, roll+weird. On a 10+, heal 1 segment. On a 7–9, heal 1 segment, but you’re also opening your brain, so roll that move next. On a miss: �rst, you don’t heal them. Second, you’ve opened both your brain and theirs to the world’s psychic maelstrom, without protection or preparation. For you, and for your patient if your patient’s a fellow player’s character, treat it as though you’ve made that move and missed the roll. For patients belonging to the MC, their experience and fate are up to the MC. Touched by death: when someone is unconscious in your care, you can use them for augury. When someone has died in your care, you can use their body for augury. Introducing THE ANGEL When you’re lying in the dust of Apocalypse World guts aspilled, for whom do you pray? e gods? ey’re long gone. Your beloved comrades? Fuckers all, or you wouldn’t be here to begin with. Your precious old mother? She’s a darling but she can’t put an intestine back inside so it’ll stay. No, you pray for some grinning kid or veteran or just someone with a heartshocker and a hand with sutures and a 6-pack of morphine. And when that someone comes, that’s an angel. GEAR & BARTER Your angel kit has all kinds of crap in it: scissors, rags, tape, needles, clamps, gloves, chill coils, wipes, alcohol, injectable tourniquets & bloodslower, instant blood packets (coffee reddener), tubes of meatmesh, bonepins & site injectors, biostabs, chemostabs, narcostabs (chillstabs) in quantity, and a roll of heart jumpshock patches for when it comes to that. It’s big enough to �ll the trunk of a car. When you use it, spend its stock; you can spend 0–3 of its stock per use. You can resupply it for 1-barter per 2-stock, if your circumstances let you barter for medical supplies. It begins play holding 6-stock. To use it to stabilize and heal someone at 9:00 or past: roll+stock spent. On a hit, they stabilize and heal to 6:00, and choose 2 (on a 10+) or 1 (on a 7–9): • ey �ght you and you have to narcostab them. How long will they be out? • e pain and drugs make them babble the truth to you. Ask them what secret they spill. • ey respond very well to treatment. Recover 1 of the stock you spent, if you spent any. • ey’re at your complete mercy. What do you do to them? • eir course of recovery teaches you something about your craft. Mark experience. • ey owe you for your time, attention, and supplies, and you’re going to hold them to it. On a miss, they take 1-harm instead. To use it to speed the recovery of someone at 3:00 or 6:00: don’t roll. ey choose: you spend 1-stock and they spend 4 days (3:00) or 1 week (6:00) blissed out on chillstabs, immobile but happy, or else they do their time in agony like everyone else. To use it to revive someone whose life has become untenable, spend 2-stock. ey come back, but you get to choose how they come back. Choose from the regular “when life is untenable” list, or else choose 1: • ey come back in your deep, deep debt. • ey come back with a prosthetic (you detail). • You and they both come back with +1weird (max weird+3). To use it to treat an NPC, spend 1-stock. ey’re stable now and they’ll recover in time. You have a supplier. At the beginning of every session, gain 1-stock, to a maximum of 6-stock. ANGEL KIT STOCK BARTER At the beginning of the session, spend 1- or 2-barter for your lifestyle. If you can’t or won’t, tell the MC and answer her questions. If you need jingle during a session, tell the MC you’d like to work a gig. Your gigs: • Tend to the health of a dozen families or more. • Serve a wealthy NPC as angel on call. • Serve a warlord NPC as combat medic. • Others, as you negotiate them. As a one-time expenditure, and very subject to availability, 1-barter might count for: a night in high luxury & company; any weapon, gear or fashion not valuable or hi-tech; repair of a piece of hi-tech gear; a session’s hire of a violent individual as bodyguard; a few sessions’ tribute to a warlord; a few sessions’ maintenance and repairs for a hi-performance vehicle well-used; bribes, fees and gifts sufficient to get you into almost anyone’s presence. For better stuff, you should expect to make particular arrangements. You can’t just wander around the commons of some hardhold with oddments ajangle and expect to �nd hi-tech or luxe eternal. CREATING AN ANGEL To create your angel, choose name, look, stats, moves, gear, and Hx. NAME Dou, Bon, Abe, Boo, T, Kal, Bai, Char, Jav, Ruth, Wei, Jay, Nee, Kim, Lan, Di, or Dez.

Choose 2 angel moves. You can use all the battle moves, but when you get the chance, look up keeping an eye out, and baiting a trap, as well as the rules for harm. GEAR You get: • angel kit, no supplier • 1 small practical weapon • oddments worth 2-barter • fashion suitable to your look, including at your option a piece worth 1-armor (you detail) Small practical weapons (choose 1): • .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud) • 9mm (2-harm close loud) • big knife (2-harm hand) • sawed-off (3-harm close reload messy) • stun gun (s-harm hand reload) If you’d like to start play with a vehicle or a prosthetic, get with the MC. HX Everyone introduces their characters by name, look and outlook. Take your turn. List the other characters’ names. Go around again for Hx. On your turn, ask 1, 2, or all 3: • Which one of you do I �gure is doomed to self-destruction? For that character, write Hx-2. • Which one of you put a hand in when it mattered, and helped me save a life? For that character, write Hx+2. • Which one of you has been beside me all along, and has seen everything I’ve seen? For that character, write Hx+3. For everyone else, write Hx+1. You keep your eyes open. On the others’ turns, answer their questions as you like. At the end, choose one of the characters with the highest Hx on your sheet. Ask that player which of your stats is most interesting, and highlight it. e MC will have you highlight a second stat too. IMPROVEMENT Whenever you roll a highlighted stat, and whenever you reset your Hx with someone, mark an experience circle. When you mark the 5 th, improve and erase. Each time you improve, choose one of the options. Check it off; you can’t choose it again. Introducing THE BATTLEBABE Even in a place as dangerous as Apocalypse World, battlebabes are, well. ey’re the ones you should walk away from, eyes down, but you can’t. ey’re the ones like the seductive blue crackling light, y’know? You mistake looking at them for falling in love, and you get too close and it’s a zillion volts and your wings burn off like paper. Dangerous. BATTLEBABE MOVES Dangerous & sexy: when you enter into a charged situation, roll+hot. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make eye contact with an NPC present, who freezes or �inches and can’t take action until you break it off. On a miss, your enemies identify you immediately as their foremost threat. Ice cold: when you go aggro on an NPC, roll+cool instead of roll+hard. When you go aggro on another player’s character, roll+Hx instead of roll+hard. Merciless: when you in�ict harm, in�ict +1harm. Visions of death: when you go into battle, roll+weird. On a 10+, name one person who’ll die and one who’ll live. On a 7–9, name one person who’ll die OR one person who’ll live. Don’t name a player’s character; name NPCs only. e MC will make your vision come true, if it’s even remotely possible. On a miss, you foresee your own death, and accordingly take -1 throughout the battle. Perfect instincts: when you’ve read a charged situation and you’re acting on the MC’s answers, take +2 instead of +1. Impossible re�exes: the way you move unencumbered counts as armor. If you’re naked or nearly naked, 2-armor; if you’re wearing non-armor fashion, 1-armor. If you’re wearing armor, use it instead.

OTHER MOVES BRAINER MOVES Unnatural lust trans�xion: when you try to seduce someone, roll+weird instead of roll+hot. Casual brain receptivity: when you read someone, roll+weird instead of roll+sharp. Your victim has to be able to see you, but you don’t have to interact. Preternatural at-will brain attunement: you get +1weird (weird+3). Deep brain scan: when you have time and physical intimacy with someone—mutual intimacy like holding them in your arms, or 1-sided intimacy like they’re restrained to a table—you can read them more deeply than normal. Roll+weird. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. While you’re reading them, spend your hold to ask their player questions, 1 for 1: • What was your character’s lowest moment? • For what does your character crave forgiveness, and of whom? • What are your character’s secret pains? • In what ways are your character’s mind and soul vulnerable? On a miss, you in�ict 1-harm (ap) upon your subject, to no bene�t. Direct-brain whisper projection: you can roll+weird to get the effects of going aggro, without going aggro. Your victim has to be able to see you, but you don’t have to interact. If your victim forces your hand, your mind counts as a weapon (1-harm ap close loud-optional). In-brain puppet strings: when you have time and physical intimacy with someone— again, mutual or 1-sided—you can plant a command inside their mind. Roll+weird. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. At your will, no matter the circumstances, you can spend your hold 1 for 1: • In�ict 1-harm (ap). • ey take -1 right now. If they ful�ll your command, that counts for all your remaining hold. On a miss, you in�ict 1-harm (ap) upon your subject, to no bene�t. Introducing THE BRAINER Brainers are the weird psycho psychic mindfucks of Apocalypse World. ey have brain control, puppet strings, creepy hearts, dead souls, and eyes like broken things. ey stand in your peripheral vision and whisper into your head, staring. ey clamp lenses over your eyes and read your secrets. ey’re just the sort of tasteful accoutrement that no well-appointed hardhold can do without.

Introducing THE CHOPPER Apocalypse World is all scarcity, of course it is. ere’s not enough wholesome food, not enough untainted water, not enough security, not enough light, not enough electricity, not enough children, not enough hope. However, the Golden Age Past did leave us two things: enough gasoline, enough bullets. Come the end, I guess the fuckers didn’t need them like they thought they would. So chopper, there you are.

Looks (choose 1 or 2): sleek, vintage, massively chopped, roaring, fat-ass, muscular, �ashy, luxe. Weakness (choose 1): slow, sloppy, guzzler, skinny, bucking, lazy, unreliable.

Fucking thieves: when you have your gang search their pockets and saddlebags for something, roll+hard. It has to be something small enough to �t. On a 10+, one of you happens to have just the thing, or close enough. On a 7–9, one of you happens to have something pretty close, unless what you’re looking for is hi-tech, in which case no dice. On a miss, one of you used to have just the thing, but it turns out that some asswipe stole it from you.

Roads heaved and split. Lines of life and communication shattered. Cities, cut off from one another, raged like smashed anthills, then burned, then fell. A few living still remember it: every horizon scorching hot with civilization in �ames, light to put out the stars and moon, smoke to put out the sun. In Apocalypse World the horizons are dark, and no roads go to them.

Backup weapons (choose 1): • 9mm (2-harm close loud) • big-ass knife (2-harm hand) • machete (3-harm hand messy) • many knives (2-harm hand in�nite) • grenades (4-harm hand area reload messy) HARM When a character gets hurt, the player marks segments in her harm countdown clock. Mark one full segment for each 1-harm, starting with the segment 12:00 to 3:00. Typically, when a character takes harm, it’s equal to the harm rating of the weapon, attack, or mishap, minus the armor rating of the character’s armor. is is called harm as established. When you suffer harm, roll+harm suffered (after armor, if you’re wearing any). On a 10+, the MC can choose 1: • You’re out of action: unconscious, trapped, incoherent or panicked. • It’s worse than it seemed. Take an additional 1-harm. • Choose 2 from the 7–9 list below. On a 7–9, the MC can choose 1: • You lose your footing. • You lose your grip on whatever you’re holding. • You lose track of someone or something you’re attending to. • You miss noticing something important. On a miss, the MC can nevertheless choose something from the 7–9 list above. If she does, it’s instead of some of the harm you’re suffering, so you take -1harm. When you in�ict harm on another player’s character, the other character gets +1Hx with you (on their sheet) for every segment of harm you in�ict. If this brings them to Hx+4, they reset to Hx+1 as usual, and therefore mark experience. When you hurt someone, they see you more clearly. BARTER At the beginning of the session, spend 1- or 2-barter for your lifestyle. If you can’t or won’t, tell the MC and answer her questions. If you need jingle during a session, tell the MC you’d like to work a gig. Your gigs: • Extort, raid, or rob a wealthy population. • Serve a wealthy NPC as a bodyguard. • Execute a murder on behalf of a wealthy NPC. • Others, as you negotiate them. As a one-time expenditure, and very subject to availability, 1-barter might count for: a night in high luxury & company; any weapon, gear or fashion not valuable or hi-tech; repair of a piece of hi-tech gear; the material costs for crash resuscitation by a medic; a few sessions’ tribute to a warlord; a few sessions’ maintenance and repairs for a hi-performance vehicle well-used; bribes, fees and gifts sufficient to get you into almost anyone’s presence. For better stuff, you should expect to make particular arrangements. You can’t just wander around the commons of some hardhold with oddments ajangle and expect to �nd hi-tech or luxe eternal.

HX Everyone introduces their characters by name, look and outlook. Take your turn. List the other characters’ names. Go around again for Hx. On your turn, ask 1, 2 or all 3: • Which one of you once left me bleeding, and did nothing for me? For that character, write Hx-2. • Which one of you has fought shoulder to shoulder with me? For that character, write Hx+2. • Which one of you is prettiest and/or smartest? For that character, write Hx+3. For everyone else, write Hx-1. You �nd no particular need to understand most people. On the others’ turns, answer their questions as you like. At the end, choose one of the characters with the highest Hx on your sheet. Ask that player which of your stats is most interesting, and highlight it. e MC will have you highlight a second stat too. IMPROVEMENT Whenever you roll a highlighted stat, and whenever you reset your Hx with someone, mark an experience circle. When you mark the 5 th, improve and erase. Each time you improve, choose one of the options. Check it off; you can’t choose it again. HARDHOLDER MOVES Leadership: when you have to order your gang to advance, regroup, hold position, hold discipline, or put their damn backs into it, roll+hard. On a hit, they do it. On a 10+, they snap to; take +1forward. On a miss, they do it, but you’ll hear about it later. Wealth: If your hold is secure and your rule unchallenged, at the beginning of the session, roll+hard. On a 10+, you have surplus at hand and available for the needs of the session. On a 7–9, you have surplus, but choose 1 want. On a miss, or if your hold is compromised or your rule contested, your hold is in want. e precise values of your surplus and want depend on your holding, as follows. OTHER MOVES BARTER Your holding provides for your day-to-day living, so while you’re there governing it, you need not spend barter for your lifestyle at the beginning of the session. When you give gifts, here’s what might count as a gift worth 1-barter: a month’s hospitality, including a place to live and meals in common with others; a night in high luxury & company; any weapon, gear or fashion not valuable or hi-tech; repair of a piece of hi-tech gear by your fave savvyhead or techso; a week’s bestowal of the protective companionship of one of your battlebabes, gunluggers, or gang members; a month’s maintenance and repairs for a hi-performance vehicle well-used; a half-hour’s worth of your undivided attention, in private audience; or, of course, oddments worth 1-barter. In times of abundance, your holding’s surplus is yours to spend personally as you see �t. (Suppose that your citizen’s lives are the more abundant too, in proportion.) You can see what 1-barter is worth, from the above. For better stuff, be prepared to make unique arrangements, probably by treating with another hardholder nearby. Introducing THE HARDHOLDER ere is no government, no society, in Apocalypse World. When hardholders ruled whole continents, when they waged war on the other side of the world instead of with the hold across the burn-�at, when their armies numbered in the hundreds of thousands and they had fucking boats to hold their fucking airplanes on, that was the golden age of legend. Now, anyone with a concrete compound and a gang of gunluggers can claim the title. What other authority is there?

You get both hardholder moves. You can use all the battle moves, and probably will, but you gotta start somewhere. When you get the chance, look up seize by force and the rules for how gangs in�ict and suffer harm. GEAR In addition to your holding, detail your personal fashion. You can have, for your personal use, with the MC’s approval, a few pieces of non-specialized gear or weapons from any character playbook. If you’d like to start play with a vehicle or a prosthetic, get with the MC. HX Everyone introduces their characters by name, look and outlook. Take your turn. List the other characters’ names.

At the end, choose one of the characters with the highest Hx on your sheet. Ask that player which of your stats is most interesting, and highlight it. e MC will have you highlight a second stat too. IMPROVEMENT Whenever you roll a highlighted stat, and whenever you reset your Hx with someone, mark an experience circle. When you mark the 5 th, improve and erase. Each time you improve, choose one of the options. Check it off; you can’t choose it again. HOCUS MOVES Fortunes: fortune, surplus and want all depend on your followers. At the beginning of the session, roll+fortune. On a 10+, your followers have surplus. On a 7–9, they have surplus, but choose 1 want. On a miss, they are in want. If their surplus lists barter, like 1-barter or 2-barter, that’s your personal share, to spend for your lifestyle or for what you will. Frenzy: When you speak the truth to a mob, roll+weird. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make the mob: • Bring people forward and deliver them. • Bring forward all their precious things. • Unite and �ght for you as a gang (2-harm 0-armor size appropriate). • Fall into an orgy of uninhibited emotion: fucking, lamenting, �ghting, sharing, celebrating, as you choose. • Go quietly back to their lives. On a miss, the mob turns on you. Charismatic: when you try to manipulate someone, roll+weird instead of roll+hot. Fucking wacknut: you get +1weird (weird+3). Seeing souls: when you help or interfere with someone, roll+weird instead of roll+Hx. Divine protection: your gods give you 1-armor. If you wear armor, use that instead, they don’t add. OTHER MOVES Introducing THE HOCUS Now it should be crystal fucking obvious that the gods have abandoned Apocalypse World. Maybe in the golden age, with its one nation under god and its in god we trust, maybe then the gods were real. Fucked if I know. All I know is that now they’re gone daddy gone. My theory is that these weird hocus fuckers, when they say “the gods,” what they really mean is the miasma left over from the explosion of psychic hate and desperation that gave Apocalypse World its birth. Friends, that’s our creator now.

He was known for dressing up real dap and whever he went, the people had much luxe tune. ere was this other guy named Maitre d’. He was known for dressing up real dap and whever he went, the people had all the food they could eat and the fanciest of it. Here in Apocalypse World, those two guys are dead. ey died and the fat sizzled off them, they died same as much-luxe-tune and all-you-can-eat. e maestro d’ now, he can’t give you what those guys used to could, but fuck it, maybe he can �nd you a little somethin somethin to take off the edge. OTHER MOVES MAESTRO D I MOVES You call this hot? when you do something under �re, roll+hot instead of roll+cool. A devil with a blade: when you use a blade to go aggro, roll+hot instead of roll+hard. Fingers in every pie: put out the word that you want a thing—could be a person, could be somethin somethin, could even be just a thing—and roll+hot. On a 10+, it shows up in your establishment for you, like magic. On a 7-9, well, your people make an effort and everybody wants to please you and close is close, right? On a miss, it shows up in your establishment for you with strings wicked attached. Everybody eats, even that guy: when you want to know something about someone important (your call), roll+hot. On a hit, you can ask the MC questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1: • How are they doing? what’s up with them? • What or who do they love best? • Who do they know, like and/or trust? • When next should I expect to see them? • How could I get to them, physically or emotionally? On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but they hear about your interest in them. Just give me a motive: name somebody who might conceivably eat, drink, or otherwise ingest something you’ve touched. If it’s an NPC, roll+hard; a PC, roll+Hx. On a 10+, they do, and suffer 4-harm (ap) sometime during the next 24 hours. On a 7-9, it’s 2-harm (ap). On a miss, some several people of the MC’s choice, maybe including your guy maybe not, get it, and all suffer 3-harm (ap). BARTER Your establishment provides for your day-to-day living, so while you’re open for business, you need not spend barter for your lifestyle at the beginning of the session. As a one-time expenditure, and very subject to availability, 1-barter might count for: any weapon, gear or fashion not valuable or hi-tech; a session’s hire of a violent individual as bodyguard; the material costs for crash resuscitation by a medic; a few sessions’ tribute to a warlord; bribes, fees and gifts sufficient to get you into almost anyone’s presence. For better stuff, you should expect to make particular arrangements. You can’t just wander around the commons of some hardhold with oddments ajangle and expect to �nd hi-tech or luxe eternal.

On a hit, you can ask the MC questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7–9, ask 1: • Who handled this last before me? • Who made this? • What strong emotions have been most recently nearby this? • What words have been said most recently nearby this? • What has been done most recently with this, or to this? • What’s wrong with this, and how might I �x it? Treat a miss as though you’ve opened your brain to the world’s psychic maelstrom and missed the roll. Bonefeel: at the beginning of the session, roll+weird. On a 10+, hold 1+1. On a 7–9, hold 1. At any time, either you or the MC can spend your hold to have you already be there, with the proper tools and knowledge, with or without any clear explanation why. If your hold was 1+1, take +1forward now. On a miss, the MC holds 1, and can spend it to have you be there already, but somehow pinned, caught or trapped. Oftener right: when a character comes to you for advice, tell them what you honestly think the best course is. If they do it, they take +1 to any rolls they make in the doing, and you mark an experience circle. Reality’s fraying edge: some component of your workspace, or some arrangement of components, is uniquely receptive to the world’s psychic maelstrom (+augury). Choose and name it, or else leave it for the MC to reveal during play. Spooky intense: when you do something under �re, stand overwatch, or bait a trap, roll+weird instead of roll+cool.

Begin by thinking up the project you’re working on this very morning, as play begins. MOVES You get all the basic moves. Choose 2 savvyhead moves.

When you go into your workspace and dedicate yourself to making a thing, or to getting to the bottom of some shit, decide what and tell the MC. e MC will tell you “sure, no problem, but…” and then 1 to 4 of the following: • It’s going to take hours/days/weeks/months of work. • First you’ll have to get/build/�x/�gure out —— . • You’re going to need —— to help you with it. • It’s going to cost you a fuckton of jingle. • e best you’ll be able to do is a crap version, weak and unreliable. • It’s going to mean exposing yourself (plus colleagues) to serious danger. • You’re going to have to add —— to your workplace �rst. • It’s going to take several/dozens/hundreds of tries. • You’re going to have to take —— apart to do it. e MC might connect them all with “and,” or might throw in a merciful “or.” Once you’ve accomplished the necessaries, you can go ahead and accomplish the thing itself. e MC will stat it up, or spill, or whatever it calls for. WORKSPACE BARTER At the beginning of the session, spend 1- or 2-barter for your lifestyle. If you can’t or won’t, tell the MC and answer her questions.

GEAR & BARTER PROJECTS SKINNER MOVES Breathtaking: you get +1hot (hot+3). Lost: when you whisper someone’s name to the world’s psychic maelstrom, roll+weird.

On a miss, you gain no bene�t, but suffer no harm or lost opportunity. You simply perform very well. An arresting skinner: when you remove a piece of clothing, your own or someone else’s, no one who can see you can do anything but watch. You command their absolute attention. If you choose, you can exempt individual people, by name. Hypnotic: when you have time and solitude with someone, they become �xated upon you. Roll+hot. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 2. ey can spend your hold, 1 for 1, by: • Giving you something you want. • Acting as your eyes and ears. • Fighting to protect you. • Doing something you tell them to. For NPCs, while you have hold over them they can’t act against you. For PCs, instead, any time you like you can spend your hold, 1 for 1: • ey distract themselves with the thought of you. ey’re acting under �re. • ey inspire themselves with the thought of you. ey take +1 right now. On a miss, they hold 2 over you, on the exact same terms. OTHER MOVES Introducing THE SKINNER Even in the �lth of Apocalypse World, there’s food that isn’t death on a spit, music that isn’t shrieking hyenas, thoughts that aren’t afraid, bodies that aren’t used meat, sex that isn’t rutting, dancing that’s real. ere are moments that are more than stench, smoke, rage and blood. Anything beautiful left in this ugly ass world, skinners hold it. Will they share it with you? What do you offer them?

If you can’t or won’t, tell the MC and answer her questions. If you need jingle during a session, tell the MC you’d like to work a gig. Your gigs: • Perform for a public audience. • Perform for a private audience. • Appear at the side of a wealthy NPC. • Others, as you negotiate them. As a one-time expenditure, and very subject to availability, 1-barter might count for: a night in high luxury & company; any weapon, gear or fashion not valuable or hi-tech; repair of a piece of hi-tech gear; a session’s hire of a violent individual as bodyguard; the material costs for crash resuscitation by a medic; a few sessions’ tribute to a warlord; a few sessions’ maintenance and repairs for a hi-performance vehicle well-used; bribes, fees and gifts sufficient to get you into almost anyone’s presence. For better stuff, you should expect to make particular arrangements. You can’t just wander around the commons of some hardhold with oddments ajangle and expect to �nd hi-tech or luxe eternal.

HX Everyone introduces their characters by name, look and outlook. Take your turn. List the other characters’ names. Go around again for Hx. On your turn, ask 1, 2, or all 3: • Which one of you is my friend? For that character, write Hx+2. • Which one of you is my lover? For that character, write Hx+1. • Which one of you is in love with me? For that character, write Hx-1. For everyone else, write Hx+1 or Hx-1, as you choose. On the others’ turns, answer their questions as you like. At the end, choose one of the characters with the highest Hx on your sheet. Ask that player which of your stats is most interesting, and highlight it. e MC will have you highlight a second stat too. IMPROVEMENT Whenever you roll a highlighted stat, and whenever you reset your Hx with someone, mark an experience circle. When you mark the 5 th, improve and erase. Each time you improve, choose one of the options. Check it off; you can’t choose it again. READ A SITCH When you read a charged situation, roll+sharp. On a hit, you can ask the MC questions. Whenever you act on one of the MC’s answers, take +1. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7–9, ask 1: • Where’s my best escape route / way in / way past? • Which enemy is most vulnerable to me? • Which enemy is the biggest threat? • What should I be on the lookout for? • What’s my enemy’s true position? • Who’s in control here? On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but be prepared for the worst. READ A PERSON When you read a person in a charged interaction, roll+sharp. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. While you’re interacting with them, spend your hold to ask their player questions, 1 for 1: • Is your character telling the truth? • What’s your character really feeling? • What does your character intend to do? • What does your character wish I’d do? • How could I get your character to —? On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but be prepared for the worst. OPEN YOUR BRAIN TO THE WORLD’S PSYCHIC MAELSTROM When you open your brain to the world’s psychic maelstrom, roll+weird. On a hit, the MC tells you something new and interesting about the current situation, and might ask you a question or two; answer them. On a 10+, the MC gives you good detail. On a 7–9, the MC gives you an impression. If you already know all there is to know, the MC will tell you that. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. LIFESTYLE AND GIGS At the beginning of the session, spend 1- or 2-barter for your lifestyle. If you can’t or won’t, tell the MC and answer her questions. If you need jingle during a session, tell the MC you’d like to work a gig. SESSION END At the end of every session, choose a character who knows you better than they used to. If there’s more than one, choose one at your whim. Tell that player to add +1 to their Hx with you on their sheet. If this brings them to Hx+4, they reset to Hx+1 (and therefore mark experience). If no one knows you better, choose a character who doesn’t know you as well as they thought, or choose any character at your whim. Tell that player to take -1 to their Hx with you on their sheet. If this brings them to Hx -3, they reset to Hx=0 (and therefore mark experience). DO SOMETHING UNDER FIRE When you do something under �re, or dig in to endure �re, roll+cool. On a 10+, you do it. On a 7–9, you �inch, hesitate, or stall: the MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. GO AGGRO ON SOMEONE When you go aggro on someone, roll+hard. On a 10+, they have to choose: • Force your hand and suck it up. • Cave and do what you want. On a 7–9, they can choose 1 of the above, or 1 of the following: • Get the hell out of your way. • Barricade themselves securely in. • Give you something they think you want, or tell you what you want to hear. • Back off calmly, hands where you can see. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. SUCKER SOMEONE When you attack someone unsuspecting or helpless, ask the MC if you could miss. If you could, treat it as going aggro, but your victim has no choice to cave and do what you want. If you couldn’t, you simply in�ict harm as established. DO BATTLE When you’re in battle, you can bring the battle moves into play. SEDUCE OR MANIPULATE SOMEONE When you try to seduce, manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, or lie to someone, tell them what you want them to do, give them a reason, and roll+hot. For NPCs: on a 10+, they’ll go along with you, unless or until some fact or action betrays the reason you gave them. On a 7–9, they’ll go along with you, but they need some concrete assurance, corroboration, or evidence �rst. For PCs: on a 10+, both. On a 7–9, choose 1: • If they go along with you, they mark experience. • If they refuse, erase one of their stat highlights for the remainder of the session. What they do then is up to them. On a miss, for either NPCs or PCs, be prepared for the worst. HELP OR INTERFERE WITH SOMEONE When you help or interfere with someone who’s making a roll, roll+Hx. On a 10+, they take +2 (help) or -2 (interfere) to their roll. On a 7–9, they take +1 (help) or -1 (interfere) to their roll. On a miss, be prepared for the worst. APOCALYPSE WORLD BASIC MOVES INSIGHT When you are able to go to someone for insight, ask them what they think your best course is, and the MC will tell you. If you pursue that course, take +1 to any rolls you make in the pursuit. If you pursue that course but don’t accomplish your ends, you mark experience. AUGURY When you are able to use something for augury, roll+weird. On a hit, you can choose 1: • Reach through the world’s psychic maelstrom to something or someone connected to it. • Isolate and protect a person or thing from the world’s psychic maelstrom. • Isolate and contain a fragment of the world’s psychic maelstrom itself. • Insert information into the world’s psychic maelstrom. • Open a window into the world’s psychic maelstrom. By default, the effect will last only as long as you maintain it, will reach only shallowly into the world’s psychic maelstrom as it is local to you, and will bleed instability. On a 10+, choose 2; on a 7–9, choose 1: • It’ll persist (for a while) without your actively maintaining it. • It reaches deep into the world’s psychic maelstrom. • It reaches broadly throughout the world’s psychic maelstrom. • It’s stable and contained, no bleeding. On a miss, whatever bad happens, your antenna takes the brunt of it. CHANGING HIGHLIGHTED STATS At the beginning of any session, or at the end if you forgot, anyone can say, “hey, let’s change highlighted stats.” When someone says it, do it. Go around the circle again, following the same procedure you used to highlight them in the �rst place: the high-Hx player highlights one stat, and the MC highlight another. HARM AND HEALING MOVES When you suffer harm, roll+harm suffered (after armor, if you’re wearing any). On a 10+, the MC can choose 1: • You’re out of action: unconscious, trapped, incoherent or panicked. • It’s worse than it seemed. Take an additional 1-harm. • Choose 2 from the 7–9 list below. On a 7–9, the MC can choose 1: • You lose your footing. • You lose your grip on whatever you’re holding. • You lose track of someone or something you’re attending to. • You miss noticing something important. On a miss, the MC can nevertheless choose something from the 7–9 list above. If she does, though, it’s instead of some of the harm you’re suffering, so you take -1harm. When you in�ict harm on another player’s character, the other character gets +1Hx with you (on their sheet) for every segment of harm you in�ict. If this brings them to Hx+4, they reset to Hx+1 as usual, and therefore mark experience. When you heal another player’s character’s harm, you get +1Hx with them (on your sheet) for every segment of harm you heal. If this brings you to Hx+4, you reset to Hx+1 as usual, and therefore mark experience. BARTER MOVES When you give 1-barter to someone, but with strings attached, it counts as manipulating them and hitting the roll with a 10+, no leverage or roll required. When you go into a holding’s bustling market, looking for some particular thing to buy, and it’s not obvious whether you should be able to just go buy one like that, roll+sharp. On a 10+, yes, you can just go buy it like that. On a 7–9, the MC chooses 1: • It costs 1-barter more than you’d expect • It’s not openly for sale, but you �nd someone who can lead you to someone selling it. • It’s not openly for sale, but you �nd someone who sold it recently, who may be willing to introduce you to their previous buyer. • It’s not available for sale, but you �nd something similar. Will it do? On a miss, the MC chooses 1, plus it costs 1-barter more. When you make known that you want a thing and drop jingle to speed it on its way, roll+barter spent (max roll+3). It has to be a thing you could legitimately get this way. On a 10+ it comes to you, no strings attached. On a 7–9 it comes to you, or something pretty close. On a miss, it comes to you, but with strings very much attached. APOCALYPSE WORLD PERIPHERAL MOVES TACTICAL AND SUPPORT MOVES When you lay down �re, roll+hard. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7–9, choose 2. On a miss, choose 1: • You provide covering �re, allowing another character to move or act freely. • You provide supporting �re, giving another PC +1choice to their own battle move. • You provide suppressing �re, denying another character to move or act freely. (If a PC, they may still act under �re.) • You take an opportune shot, in�icting harm (but -1harm) on an enemy within your reach. When you stand overwatch for an ally, roll+cool. On a hit, if anyone attacks or interferes with your ally, you attack them and in�ict harm as established, as well as warning your ally. On a 10+, choose 1: • …And you in�ict your harm before they can carry out their attack or interference. • …And you in�ict terrible harm (+1harm). On a miss, you are able to warn your ally but not attack your enemy. When you keep an eye out for what’s coming, roll+sharp. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 2. On a miss, hold 1. During the battle, spend your hold, 1 for 1, to ask the MC what’s coming and choose 1: • Direct a PC ally’s attention to an enemy. If they make a battle move against that enemy, they get +1choice to their move. • Give a PC ally an order, instruction, or suggestion. If they do it, they get +1 to any rolls they make in the effort. • Direct any ally’s attention to an enemy. If they attack that enemy, they in�ict +1harm. • Direct any ally’s attention to a danger. ey take -1harm from that danger. SUBTERFUGE MOVES When you’re the bait, roll+cool. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7–9, choose 1: • You draw your prey all the way into the trap. Otherwise, they only approach. • Your prey doesn’t suspect you. Otherwise, they’re wary and alert. • You don’t expose yourself to extra risk. Otherwise, any harm your prey in�icts is +1. On a miss, the MC chooses 1 for you. When you’re the cat, roll+cool. On a hit, you catch your prey out. On a 10+, you’ve driven them �rst to a place of your choosing; say where. On a 7–9, you’ve had to follow them where they wanted to go; they say where. On a miss, your prey escapes you. When you’re the mouse, roll+cool. On a 10+, you escape clean and leave your hunter hunting. On a 7–9, your hunter catches you out, but only after you’ve led them to a place of your choosing; say where. On a miss, your hunter catches you out and the MC says where. When it’s not certain whether you’re the cat or the mouse, roll+sharp. On a hit, you decide which you are. On a 10+, you take +1forward as well. On a miss, you’re the mouse. EXCHANGING HARM When you exchange harm, both sides simultaneously in�ict and suffer harm as established: • You in�ict harm equal to the harm rating of your weapon, minus the armor rating of your enemy’s armor. • You suffer harm equal to the harm rating of your enemy’s weapon, minus the armor rating of your own armor. SEIZE BY FORCE To seize something by force, exchange harm, but �rst roll+hard. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7–9, choose 2. On a miss, choose 1: • You in�ict terrible harm (+1harm). • You suffer little harm (-1harm). • You take de�nite and undeniable control of it. • You impress, dismay, or frighten your enemy. Variations • To assault a secure position, roll to seize by force, but instead of choosing to take de�nite control of it, you can choose to force your way into your enemy’s position. • To keep hold of something you have, roll to seize by force, but instead of choosing to take de�nite control, you can choose to keep de�nite control of it. • To �ght your way free, roll to seize by force, but instead of choosing to take de�nite control, you can choose to win free and get away. • To defend someone else from attack, roll to seize by force, but instead of choosing to take de�nite control, you can choose to protect them from harm. SINGLE COMBAT When you do single combat with someone, no quarters, exchange harm, but �rst roll+hard. On a 10+, both. On a 7–9, choose 1. On a miss, your opponent chooses 1 against you: • You in�ict terrible harm (+1harm). • You suffer little harm (-1harm). After you exchange harm, do you prefer to end the �ght now, or �ght on? If both of you prefer to end the �ght now, it ends. If both of you prefer to �ght on, it continues, and you must make the move again. If one of you prefers to end the �ght, though, and the other prefers to �ght on, then the former must choose: �ee, submit to the latter‘s mercy, or �ght on after all. APOCALYPSE WORLD BATTLE MOVES BOARD A MOVING VEHICLE To board a moving vehicle, roll+cool, minus its speed. To board one moving vehicle from another, roll+cool, minus the difference between their speeds. On a 10+, you’re on and you made it look easy. Take +1forward. On a 7–9, you’re on, but jesus. On a miss, the MC chooses: you’re hanging on for dear life, or you’re down and good luck to you. OUTDISTANCE ANOTHER VEHICLE When you try to outdistance another vehicle, roll+cool, modi�ed by the vehicles’ relative speed. On a 10+, you outdistance them and break away. On a 7–9, choose 1: • You outdistance them and break away, but your vehicle suffers 1-harm ap from the strain. • You don’t escape them, but you can go to ground in a place you choose. • ey overtake you, but their vehicle suffers 1-harm ap from the strain. On a miss, your counterpart chooses 1 against you. OVERTAKE ANOTHER VEHICLE When you try to overtake another vehicle, roll+cool, modi�ed by the vehicles’ relative speed. On a 10+, you overtake them and draw alongside. On a 7–9, choose 1: • You overtake them, but your vehicle suffers 1-harm ap the same. • You don’t overtake them, but you can drive them into a place you choose. • ey outdistance you, but their vehicle suffers 1-harm ap the same. On a miss, your counterpart chooses 1 against you. DEAL WITH BAD TERRAIN When you have to deal with bad terrain, roll+cool, plus your vehicle’s handling. On a 10+, you �y through untouched. On a 7–9, choose 1: • You slow down and pick your way forward. • You push too hard and your vehicle suffers harm as established. • You ditch out and go back or try to �nd another way. On a miss, the MC chooses 1 for you; the others are impossible. SHOULDER ANOTHER VEHICLE To shoulder another vehicle, roll+cool. On a hit, you shoulder it aside, in�icting v-harm as established. On a 10+, you in�ict v-harm+1. On a miss, it shoulders you instead, in�icting v-harm as established. APOCALYPSE WORLD ROAD WAR MOVES CREATING A VEHICLE By default, your vehicle has speed=0, handling=0, 0-armor, and the massive rating of its frame. Choose its frame: • Bike (massive=0, 1 battle option) • Compact, buggy (massive=1, 2 battle options) • Coupe, sedan, jeep, pickup, van, limo, 4x4, farm tractor (massive=2, 2 battle options) • Semi, bus, ambulance, construction/utility (massive=3, 2 battle options) Strengths (choose 1 or 2): Fast, rugged, aggressive, tight, huge, off-road, responsive, uncomplaining, capacious, workhorse, easily repaired. Looks (choose 1 or 2): Sleek, vintage, pristine, powerful, luxe, �ashy, muscular, quirky, pretty, handcrafted, spikes & plates, garish, cobbled-together, hardworked. Weakness (choose 1 or 2): Slow, loud, lazy, sloppy, cramped, picky, guzzler, unreliable, rabbity, temperamental. Battle options (choose according to frame): +1speed, +1handling, +1massive, +1armor. You can double up if you choose. CREATING A SPECIALIZED BATTLE VEHICLE Create the vehicle as normal, and then choose 2: • +1 battle option (+1speed, +1handling, +1massive, or +1armor) • Mounted machine guns (3-harm close/far area messy) • Mounted grenade launcher (4-harm close area messy) • Ram or ramming spikes (as a weapon, vehicle in�icts +1harm) • Mounted 50cal mg (5-harm far area messy) • Mounted boarding platform or harness (+1 to attempts to board another vehicle from this one) LCREATING VEHICLES HARM Harm as established equals the in�icter’s weapon’s harm minus the sufferer’s armor. When you suffer harm, make the harm move. EXCHANGING HARM When you exchange harm, both sides simultaneously in�ict and suffer harm as established: • You in�ict harm equal to the harm rating of your weapon, minus the armor rating of your enemy’s armor. • You suffer harm equal to the harm rating of your enemy’s weapon, minus the armor rating of your own armor. DEGREES OF HARM For each 1-harm you suffer, mark a segment of her harm countdown clock. Start in the 12:00–3:00 segment and continue around clockwise. e three segments before 9:00 are less serious, the three segments after 9:00 are more serious. Mark the 11:00–12:00 segment and your character’s life has become untenable. Before 6:00, harm will go away by itself with time. 6:00–9:00, the harm won’t get worse or better by itself. After 9:00, unstabilized harm will get worse by itself, stabilized harm will not, and it’ll get better only with medical treatment. When life becomes untenable, choose 1: • Come back with -1hard • Come back with +1weird (max+3) • Change to a new playbook • Die WHEN AN NPC TAKES HARM 1-harm: cosmetic damage, pain, concussion, fear if the NPC’s likely to be afraid of pain. 2-harm: wounds, unconsciousness, bad pain, broken bones, shock. Likely fatal, occasionally immediately fatal. 3-harm: give it 50-50 it’s immediately fatal. Otherwise, terrible wounds, shock, death soon. 4-harm: usually immediately fatal, but sometimes the poor fuck has to wait to die, mangled and ruined. 5-harm and more: fatal and increasingly bodily destructive. APOCALYPSE WORLD HARM RULES USING A GANG AS A WEAPON When you have a gang, you can sucker someone, go aggro on them, or make a battle move, using your gang as a weapon. When you do, you roll the dice and make your choices, but it’s your gang that in�icts and suffers harm, not you yourself. Gangs in�ict and suffer harm as established, as usual: they in�ict harm equal to their own harm rating, minus their enemy’s armor rating, and the suffer harm equal to their enemy’s harm rating minus their own armor. Harm = weapon - armor. However, if there’s a size mismatch, the bigger gang in�icts +1harm and gets +1armor for each step of size difference: • Against a single person, a small gang in�icts +1harm and gets +1armor. A medium gang in�icts +2harm and gets +2armor, and a large gang in�icts +3harm and gets +3armor. • Against a small gang, a medium gang in�icts +1harm and gets +1armor, and a large gang in�icts +2harm and gets +2armor. • Against a medium gang, a large gang in�icts +1harm and gets +1armor. WHEN A GANG TAKES HARM 1-harm: a few injuries, one or two serious, no fatalities. 2-harm: many injuries, several serious, a couple of fatalities. 3-harm: widespread injuries, many serious, several fatalities. 4-harm: widespread serious injuries, many fatalities. 5-harm and more: widespread fatalities, few survivors. Does the gang hold together? With a strong, present leader, a gang will hold together if it suffers up to 4-harm. If the leader is weak or absent, it’ll hold together if it suffers up to 3-harm. If the leader is both weak and absent, it’ll hold together if it suffers 1- or 2-harm. If it has no leader, it’ll hold together if it suffers 1-harm, but no more. A PC gang leader can hold a gang together by imposing her will on it, if she has pack alpha, or by ordering it to hold discipline, if she has leadership, but otherwise it follows these rules, same as for NPCs. What about PC gang members? If a PC is a member of a gang taking harm, how much harm the PC takes depends on her role in the gang. If she’s a leader or a prominent, visible member, she suffers the same harm the gang does. If she’s just someone in the gang, or if she’s intentionally protecting herself from harm instead of �ghting with the gang, she suffers 1-harm less. L1 USING A VEHICLE AS A WEAPON When you’re behind the wheel, you can sucker someone, go aggro on them, or make a battle move, using your vehicle as a weapon. When you do, you roll the dice and make your choices, but it’s your vehicle that in�icts and suffers harm, not you yourself. Against a person: • A glancing hit from a moving vehicle in�icts 2-harm (ap). • A direct hit from a moving vehicle in�icts 3-harm (ap) plus its massive. Against another vehicle: • A glancing hit in�icts v-harm. • A direct hit in�icts 3-harm plus its massive, minus the target vehicle’s massive and armor. Treat 0-harm and less as v-harm. • When you’re able to ram or T-bone another vehicle, you in�ict the harm of a direct hit (3-harm +massive, minus your target’s armor +massive) and suffer the harm of a glancing hit (v-harm). Against a building or structure: • A glancing hit from a moving vehicle in�icts 2-harm. • A direct hit from a moving vehicle in�icts 3-harm plus its massive, minus the structure’s armor. WHEN A VEHICLE SUFFERS HARM Vehicles can suffer regular harm, from bullets, explosions, and direct hits from other vehicles, or v-harm, from glancing hits. When a vehicle suffers regular harm, there are two considerations: how much damage the vehicle itself suffers, and how much harm blows through to the people inside. 1-harm: cosmetic damage. Bullet holes, broken glass, smoke. 0-harm can blow through to passengers. 2-harm: functional damage. Fuel leak, shot-out tires, engine stall, problems with steering, braking or acceleration. Can be �eld-patched. 1-harm can blow through to passengers. 3-harm: serious damage. Functional damage affecting multiple functions, but can be �eld-patched. 2-harm can blow through to passengers. 4-harm: breakdown. Catastrophic functional damage, can be repaired in a garage but not in the �eld, or can used for parts. 3-harm can blow through to passengers. 5-harm and more: total destruction. Full harm can blow through to passengers, plus they can suffer additional harm if the vehicle explodes or crashes. Whether harm blows through to a vehicle’s driver and passengers, doesn’t blow through, or just hits them too without having to blow through, depends on the MC’s judgment of the circumstances and the vehicle. APOCALYPSE WORLD HARM RULES V-HARM V-harm as established is the attacking car’s massive minus the defending car’s massive or handling, defender’s choice. When you suffer v-harm, roll+v-harm suffered. On a 10+, you lose control, and your attacker chooses 1: • You crash. • You spin out. • Choose 2 from the 7–9 list below. On a 7–9, you’re forced to swerve. Your attacker chooses 1: • You give ground. • You’re driven off course, or forced onto a new course. • Your car takes 1-harm ap, right in the transmission. On a miss, you swerve but recover without disadvantage. WHEN A BUILDING TAKES HARM As with vehicles, when a building suffers harm, there are two considerations: structural damage to the building itself, and how much of the harm blows through to the people inside. Harm to buildings and other structures is non-cumulative. Don’t bother tracking a building’s harm on a countdown. Shooting a building 3 times with your 3-harm shotgun doesn’t add up to 9-harm and make the building collapse. When a building or structure suffers… 1-harm – 3-harm: cosmetic damage. Bullet holes, broken glass, scorch marks, chipped surfaces. 0-harm can blow through to inhabitants. 4-harm – 6-harm: severe cosmetic damage. Many holes or large holes, no intact glass, burning or smoldering. 2-harm can blow through to inhabitants. 7-harm – 8-harm: Structural damage. Strained load-bearing walls or pillars, partial collapse, raging �re. 4-harm can blow through to inhabitants. Further structural damage can lead to full collapse. 9-harm and more: destruction. Full harm can blow through to inhabitants, plus they can suffer additional harm as the building or structure collapses. Whether harm actually does through to a building’s inhabitants depends on the MC’s judgment of the circumstances and the building. Don’t stand near the windows!

On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make eye contact with an NPC present, who freezes or �inches and can’t take action until you break it off.

If you happen to be leading a gang or convoy, it gets +1armor too. Deep brain scan [brainer]: when you have time and physical intimacy with someone—mutual intimacy like holding them in your arms, or 1-sided intimacy like they’re restrained to a table—you can read them more deeply than normal.

If you wear armor, use that instead, they don’t add. Everybody eats, even that guy [maestro d’]: when you want to know something about someone important (your call), roll+hot. On a hit, you can ask the MC questions. On a 10+, ask 3.

On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but they hear about your interest in them. Eye on the door [driver]: name your escape route and roll+cool. On a 10+, you’re gone. On a 7–9, you can go or stay, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the MC will tell you what. On a miss, you’re caught vulnerable, half in and half out. A devil with a blade [maestro d’]: when you use a blade to go aggro, roll+hot instead of roll+hard. An arresting skinner [skinner]: when you remove a piece of clothing, your own or someone else’s, no one who can see you can do anything but watch. You command their absolute attention. If you choose, you can exempt individual people, by name.

At any time, either you or the MC can spend your hold to have you already be there, with the proper tools and knowledge, with or without any clear explanation why.

Breathtaking [skinner]: you get +1hot (hot+3). Casual brain receptivity [brainer]: when you read someone, roll+weird instead of roll+sharp.

Collector [driver]: you get 2 additional cars (you detail). APOCALYPSE WORLD CHARACTER MOVES L2 Hypnotic [skinner]: when you have time and solitude with someone, they become �xated upon you. Roll+hot. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 2. ey can spend your hold, 1 for 1, by: • giving you something you want • acting as your eyes and ears • �ghting to protect you • doing something you tell them to For NPCs, while you have hold over them they can’t act against you. For PCs, instead, any time you like you can spend your hold, 1 for 1: • they distract themselves with the thought of you. ey’re acting under �re. • they inspire themselves with the thought of you. ey take +1 right now. On a miss, they hold 2 over you, on the exact same terms. Ice cold [battlebabe]: when you go aggro on an NPC, roll+cool instead of roll+hard. When you go aggro on another player’s character, roll+Hx instead of roll+hard. Impossible re�exes [battlebabe]: the way you move unencumbered counts as armor. If you’re naked or nearly naked, 2-armor; if you’re wearing non-armor fashion, 1-armor. If you’re wearing armor, use it instead.

On a miss, you in�ict 1-harm (ap) upon your subject, to no bene�t. In�rmary [angel]: you get an in�rmary, a workspace with life support, a drug lab and a crew of 2 (Shigusa & Mox, maybe). Get patients into it and you can work on them like a savvyhead on tech (cf). Insano like Drano [gunlugger]: you get +1hard (hard+3). Just give me a motive [maestro d’]: name somebody who might conceivably eat, drink, or otherwise ingest something you’ve touched. If it’s an NPC, roll+hard; a PC, roll+Hx. On a 10+, they do, and suffer 4-harm (ap) sometime during the next 24 hours. On a 7-9, it’s 2-harm (ap). On a miss, some several people of the MC’s choice, maybe including your guy maybe not, get it, and all suffer 3-harm (ap). Leadership [hardholder]: when you have to order your gang to advance, regroup, hold position, hold discipline, or put their damn backs into it, roll+hard. On a hit, they do it. On a 10+, they snap to; take +1forward. On a miss, they do it, but you’ll hear about it later. Fingers in every pie [maestro d’]: put out the word that you want a thing—could be a person, could be somethin somethin, could even be just a thing—and roll+hot. On a 10+, it shows up in your establishment for you, like magic. On a 7-9, well, your people make an effort and everybody wants to please you and close is close, right? On a miss, it shows up in your establishment for you with strings wicked attached. Fortunes [hocus]: fortune, surplus and want all depend on your followers. At the beginning of the session, roll+fortune. On a 10+, your followers have surplus. On a 7–9, they have surplus, but choose 1 want. On a miss, they are in want. If their surplus lists barter, like 1-barter or 2-barter, that’s your personal share, to spend for your lifestyle or for what you will. Frenzy [hocus]: When you speak the truth to a mob, roll+weird. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make the mob: • bring people forward and deliver them. • bring forward all their precious things. • unite and �ght for you as a gang (2harm 0-armor size appropriate). • fall into an orgy of uninhibited emotion: fucking, lamenting, �ghting, sharing, celebrating, as you choose. • go quietly back to their lives. On a miss, the mob turns on you. Fuck this shit [gunlugger]: name your escape route and roll+hard. On a 10+, sweet, you’re gone. On a 7–9, you can go or stay, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind, or take something with you, the MC will tell you what. On a miss, you’re caught vulnerable, half in and half out. Fucking thieves [chopper]: when you have your gang search their pockets and saddlebags for something, roll+hard. It has to be something small enough to �t. On a 10+, one of you happens to have just the thing, or close enough. On a 7–9, one of you happens to have something pretty close, unless what you’re looking for is hi-tech, in which case no dice. On a miss, one of you used to have just the thing, but it turns out that some asswipe stole it from you. Fucking wacknut [hocus]: you get +1weird (weird+3). Healing touch [angel]: when you put your hands skin-to-skin on a wounded person and open your brain to them, roll+weird. On a 10+, heal 1 segment. On a 7–9, heal 1 segment, but you’re acting under �re from your patient’s brain. On a miss: �rst, you don’t heal them. Second, you’ve opened both your brain and theirs to the world’s psychic maelstrom, without protection or preparation. For you, and for your patient if your patient’s a fellow player’s character, treat it as though you’ve made that move and missed the roll. For NPC patients, their experience and fate is up to the MC.

On a 7–9, choose 1: • they do what you want (otherwise, they refuse) • they don’t �ght back over it (otherwise, they do �ght back) • you don’t have to make an example of one of them (otherwise, you must) On a miss, someone in your gang makes a bid, idle or serious, to replace you for alpha. Perfect instincts [battlebabe]: when you’ve read a charged situation and you’re acting on the MC’s answers, take +2 instead of +1. Prepared for the inevitable [gunlugger]: you have a well-stocked and high-quality �rst aid kit. It counts as an angel kit (cf) with a capacity of 2-stock.

Treat a miss as though you’ve opened your brain to the world’s psychic maelstrom and missed the roll. Touched by death [angel]: when someone is unconscious in your care, you can use them for augury. When someone has died in your care, you can use their body for augury. Unnatural lust trans�xion [brainer]: when you try to seduce someone, roll+weird instead of roll+hot. Visions of death [battlebabe]: when you go into battle, roll+weird. On a 10+, name one person who’ll die and one who’ll live. On a 7–9, name one person who’ll die OR one person who’ll live.

APOCALYPSE WORLD CHARACTER MOVES L1THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES AGENDA • Make Apocalypse World seem real. • Make the players’ characters’ lives not boring. • Play to �nd out what happens. ALWAYS SAY • What the principles demand. • What the rules demand. • What your prep demands. • What honesty demands. THE PRINCIPLES • Barf forth apocalyptica. • Address yourself to the characters, not the players. • Make your move, but misdirect. • Make your move, but never speak its name. • Look through crosshairs. • Name everyone, make everyone human. • Ask provocative questions and build on the answers. • Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards. • Be a fan of the players’ characters. • ink offscreen too. • Sometimes, disclaim decision-making. YOUR MOVES • Separate them. • Capture someone. • Put someone in a spot. • Trade harm for harm (as established). • Announce off-screen badness. • Announce future badness. • In�ict harm (as established). • Take away their stuff. • Make them buy. • Activate their stuff’s downside. • Tell them the possible consequences and ask. • Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost. • Turn their move back on them. • Make a threat move (from one of your threats). • After every move: “what do you do?” ESSENTIAL THREATS • Where the PCs are, create as a landscape. • For any PC’s gang, create as brutes. • For any PC’s other NPCs, create as brutes, plus a grotesque and/or a wannabe warlord. • For any PCs’ vehicles, create as vehicles. • In any local populations, create an affliction. e players have it easy. ey have these fun little procedures to go through and then they’re ready to play. Your job is harder, you have a lot more to set up than they do. ey each have one character to create, you have the whole bedamned world, so you get the whole �rst session to create it in. DURING CHARACTER CREATION While the players are making their characters, here are some things to get out up-front: • Your characters don’t have to be friends, but they should de�nitely be allies. • Your characters are unique in Apocalypse World. • 1-armor can be armor or clothing. 2-armor is armor. • Is barter a medium of exchange? What do you use? • I’m not out to get you. I’m here to �nd out what’s going to happen. Same as you! DURING THE FIRST SESSION • MC the game. Bring it. • Describe. Barf forth apocalyptica. • Springboard off character creation. • Ask questions all the time. • Leave yourself things to wonder about. Note them on the threat map. • Look for where they’re not in control. • Push there. • Nudge the players to have their characters make moves. • Give every character good screen time with other characters. • Leap forward with named, human NPCs. • Hell, have a �ght. • Work on your threat map and essential threats. THE THREAT MAP During play, keep notes on the threats in the world by noting them on your threat map. e innermost circle is for the PCs and their resources. ere, list the PCs’ gangs, followers, crews, vehicles, and everything else they own that you’ll be responsible to play. Most of your essential threats go here. e next circle out, “closer,” is for the NPCs that surround them and their immediate landscape. e third circle, “farther,” is for things that they would have to travel in order to encounter. ings that they have only heard rumors of, or ideas you have that you have not yet introduced, you can write outside the circle, as “notional.” North, south, east and west are for geography. Up and down are for above and below. In is for threats within the local or surrounding landscape or population, out is for threats originating in the world’s psychic maelstrom or even elsewhere. AFTER THE FIRST SESSION • Go back over the threat map. Pull it apart into individual threats. • Consider the resources that are available to each of them, and the resources that aren’t. • Create them as threats, using the threat creation rules. • Before the second session, be sure you’ve created your essential threats. A FEW MORE THINGS TO DO • Make maps. • Turn questions back on the asker or over to the group at large. • Digress occasionally. • Elide the action sometimes, and zoom in on its details other times. • Go around the table. • Take breaks and take your time. DURING SESSION 1 • MC the game. Bring it. • Describe. Barf forth apocalyptica. • Springboard off character creation. • Ask every question you think of. • Leave yourself things to wonder about. • Look for where they’re not in control. • Push there. • Nudge the players to have their characters make moves. • Give every character good screen time with other characters. • Leap forward with named, human NPCs. • Hell, have a �ght. • Start creating your threat map. DECISION-MAKING In order to play to �nd out what happens, you’ll need to pass decision-making off sometimes. Whenever something comes up that you’d prefer not to decide by personal whim and will, don’t. e game gives you four key tools you can use to disclaim responsibility. You can: • Put it in your NPCs’ hands. • Put it in the players’ hands. • Create a countdown. • Make it a stakes question.

Whatever other people eat, drink, and wear, she’s eating, drinking, and wearing better. She sleeps more comfortably and safer, and has more control over her personal environment.

Take away her stuff. • Choose a suitable NPC—Rolfball, for instance—and say, “oh, that’s okay, Rolfball’s got you covered. at’s good with you, yeah?” Now there’s a debt is between her and your NPC, and you can bring it into play however you like. • Say, “well, okay, who do you think should pay to keep you alive? Rolfball? Fish? Who?” You can either negotiate an appropriate arrangement in summary, or else jump into play: have her read a person, seduce & manipulate, go aggro, or whatever she needs to do to get her way. And remember that if she doesn’t pay, and the other PCs don’t pay, and no NPC pays, then tough luck. She’s desperately hungry, dying of thirst, and you should in�ict harm and take away her stuff. GIGS When a player tells you that her character would like to work a gig, ask her what she has in mind. She might pick one from her list, or she might suggest a new one. It’s up to you to decide whether to say yes, no, or not yet, like “that’s a good idea, but �rst you’ll have to…” Once you’ve settled that question and the character works the gig, you have to decide or �nd out how it goes. Successful? Unsuccessful? Dangerous? Easy? • You can just decide. • You can play it out in full. • You can call for a move, or a quick snowball of moves, to summarize what happens. No matter which way you do it, the baseline for pay is, when they work a gig, they get 3-barter. You’re allowed to pay 2- or 4-barter when you feel like you should, but save them for exceptional outcomes. SELECTED MC RULES CREATING A VEHICLE ese are rules for a wider range of vehicles than is usually available to the PCs. By default, any vehicle has speed=0, handling=0, 0-armor, and the massive rating of its frame. Name its frame and assign it a massive from 0 up. Use these examples to guide you: • Massive=0: bike, jetski, canoe, ultralight. 1 battle option. • Massive=1: trike or big 4-wheeler, tiny car, rowboat. 2 battle options. • Massive=2: car, small speedboat, autogyro. 2 battle options. • Massive=3: huge road vehicle, speedboat, yacht, small helicopter, small prop plane. 2 battle options. • Massive=4: huge construction vehicle, an actual tank, tour boat, helicopter, small jet, single train car. 3 battle options. • Massive=5: large tour boat, large helicopter, small passenger plane or jet. 4 battle options. • Massive over 5: for each 1massive over, add +1battle option. Strengths (choose 1 or 2): Fast, rugged, aggressive, tight, huge, off-road, responsive, uncomplaining, capacious, workhorse, easily repaired, or make one up. Looks (choose 1 or 2): Sleek, vintage, pristine, powerful, luxe, �ashy, muscular, quirky, pretty, handcrafted, spikes & plates, garish, cobbled-together, hardworked, or make one up. Weakness (choose 1 or 2): Slow, loud, lazy, sloppy, cramped, picky, guzzler, unreliable, rabbity, temperamental, or make one up. Battle options (choose according to frame): +1speed, +1handling, +1massive, +1armor. You can double up if you choose. CREATING A SPECIALIZED BATTLE VEHICLE Create the vehicle as normal, and then choose 2: • +1 battle option (+1speed, +1handling, +1massive, or +1armor) • Mounted machine guns (3-harm close/far area messy) • Mounted grenade launcher (4-harm close area messy) • Ram or ramming spikes (as a weapon, vehicle in�icts +1harm) • Mounted 50cal mg (5-harm far area messy) • Mounted boarding platform or harness (+1 to attempts to board another vehicle from this one) L1 D-HARM A person suffers d-harm from deprivation. d-harm is strictly for acute cases of deprivation. For scarcity and chronic deprivation, create affliction threats instead. Individual NPCs simply suffer the effects of d-harm as follows. For PCs suffering d-harm, tell them the effects they’re suffering, and if they can’t or don’t alleviate their deprivation, in�ict regular harm alongside it, in increments of 1-harm ap. For a population suffering d-harm, the two questions are how it behaves, and how long it can last before breaking up, tearing itself apart, or dying. d-harm (air), asphyxiation: Difficulty breathing, panic, convulsions, paralysis, unconsciousness, brain damage, death within minutes. In�icted on a population: Immediate panic. Social cohesion breaks down basically at once into a survival-driven desperation to �nd air. d-harm (warmth), hypothermia: shivering, hunger, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, frostbite, delirium, unconsciousness, irregular heartbeat, death in an hour or more, depending on the cold. In�icted on a population: Huddling together, despair, lethargy, resignation. Isolated individuals suffer worsening individual symptoms, so social cohesion can last basically as long as the individuals can. d-harm (cool), heat stroke: headache, dehydration, weakness or cramps, confusion, fever, vomiting, seizures, unconsciousness, death in an hour or more, depending on the heat. In�icted on a population: Desperation, panic, lethargy, resignation. Social cohesion can last as long as the individuals can, as the less vulnerable individuals try to help the more vulnerable. d-harm (water), dehydration: desperation, headache, confusion, delirium, collapse, death in 3 days. In�icted on a population: Rationing & hoarding, desperation, in�ghting. Social cohesion can last up to a week before breaking down into violence or dispersal. d-harm (food), starvation: irritability, hunger, weakness, diarrhea, lethargy, dehydration, muscular atrophy, heart failure and death within 2–3 months. In�icted on a population: Rationing & hoarding, desperation, in�ghting. Social cohesion can last up to 2 weeks before breaking down into violence, cannibalism, or dispersal. d-harm (sleep), sleep deprivation, irritability, disorientation, nodding off, depression, headache, hallucinations, mania, personality changes, bizarre behavior. In�icted on a population: Malaise, in�ghting, tantrums, desperation. For long-term acute sleep deprivation, create affliction threats instead. SELECTED MC RULES Ψ-HARM A person suffers Ψ-harm from exposure to the world’s psychic maelstrom. When an NPC suffers Ψ-harm, create her as a threat if necessary, and then choose any or all: • She aggressively pursues her threat impulse. Make moves on her behalf as hard and as direct as you can. • Her sanity shatters. She is incoherent, raving, raging or unresponsive, alive but gone. • She abruptly changes threat type. For players’ characters: When you suffer Ψ-harm, roll+Ψ-harm suffered (typically, roll+1). On a 10+, the MC can choose 1: • You’re out of action: unconscious, trapped, incoherent or panicked. • You’re out of your own control. You come to yourself again a few seconds later, having done I-don’t-know-what. • Choose 2 from the 7–9 list below. On a 7–9, the MC can choose 1: • You lose your footing. • You lose your grip on whatever you’re holding. • You lose track of someone or something you’re attending to. • You miss noticing something important. • You take a single concrete action of the MC’s choosing. On a miss, you keep it together and overcome the -harm with no effect. S-HARM s-harm means stun. It disables its target without causing any regular harm. Use it on a PC, and doing anything at all means doing it under �re; the �re is “you’re stunned.” L2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
