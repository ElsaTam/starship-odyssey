# Empyrean Veil

- Residential area of the [[Ethereons]]
- managed by the [[Ethereon Subcommittee]] of the [[Atlas Council]]
- located in the [[Midbrain Sector]]
- light, weightless, blue and green
- like being in a nebula
- loose, holographic architecture
- shift and ripple
- meditation spheres float around like planets or asteriods
- dreamy, liminal
- living history of all events record as pure energy patterns
	- MUST in game terms have insanely high cosmic to connect with even a portion of it or you could go mad
	- EACH SPECIES HAVE THEIR OWN ARCHIVES UNTOUCHED BY [[Chronos Archives]] archivists
