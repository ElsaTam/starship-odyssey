# Playbooks

## Playbooks in Starship Odyssey

#needsWriting 

- What are playbooks? Mix of role + archetype + class
- Explain for people familiar with only D&D
- Explain for people who have never played a TTRPG
- Thought: If character creation is an application to join the Odyssey, are playbooks role or assignment? A multiple choice quiz? A Cosmo personality test? 

## Playbook Framework: Function & Method

#needsWriting 

Introduction paragraph

### Function

#needsRevision 

- **Volition:** Characters who prioritize volition take bold, often risky moves, and have a strong bias towards action. They're often bored by details, preferring instead to have a large and dramatic impact on events. 
- **Agency:** Characters who value agency have a strong presence, which they use to be heard and make a difference. These characters have developed sense of personal power and can often be found in leadership positions wherever they go.
- **Mutability:** Characters who are mutable are adaptive and flexible. They know how to support their allies, often in both physical and intellectual ways. With a solution for almost any problem that comes their way, they are valued within their communities.

### Method

#needsRevision 

- **Technology:** Technology is more than hardware and code on the Odyssey. Technologists bend reality to their will using machines, algorithms, and engineered systems. They don't just use machines, but instead become symbiotic with them.
- **Magical Energy:** The cosmic power discovered in deep space is beyond current understanding, but Magicians who work with it weave themselves into the celestial narrative. Magic is no longer superstition, but instead an ancient wellspring that resonates with special individuals.
- **Xenology:** This field is the study and lived experience of the alien. This method draws on the biological, cultural, and metaphysical insight of species different from one's own. Xenologists rely on developing a deep understanding of what is strange to them.
