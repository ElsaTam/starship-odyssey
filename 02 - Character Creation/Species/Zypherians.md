# Zypherians

- Bird people
- V tall
- Inspired by corvids, perhaps other inspirations
- Look dull to humans, but can see ultraviolet colors, and therefore have a lot of biological information shown in UV on their feathers. A Zypherian could look at another Zypherian and know their age, gender, mating availability, reproductive history, etc.
- Curious, exploration.
- Storytelling is important
- Can communicate long distance via aerial gymnastics
- Species specific move ideas
	- Aerial dance. (needs better name) Roll + Expressive. On hit, you communicate long distance
	- Story telling (needs better name).
