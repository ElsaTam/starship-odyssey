# Basic Moves

## What Are Basic Moves

In *Powered by the Apocalypse* games, basic moves are actions that any player can take, regardless of playbook.

Remember, this game is fiction-first, meaning the experience is richer if you describe what you intend to do, not just the move name. Likewise, the GM will explain how you succeeded (or failed) in terms of the setting.

For any move, you'll describe what you do, then say what move you intend trigger. Then you'll roll two six-sided die (often shortened as 2d6) and add the relevant [[Stats|stat]]. A 10+ is a success. 7 to 9 means a partial success, which your GM will describe; Maybe you succeed, but there are unintended consequences. On a 6-, you failed, which your GM will describe as well.

## Basic Moves in Starship Odyssey

### **Establish Order** ( + Disciplined )

To enforce rules or impose structure where there is chaos, name aloud what authority you're acting under and how you attempt to establish order. Roll 2d6 + Disciplined.

On a 10+, you successfully take command of the situation.
On a 7 to 9, you reassert the rules, but the people involved develop frustration, resentment, or aggression.
On a 6-, your attempt to control the situation fails, and the disorder increases unbridled.

### **Create An Innovation** ( + Expressive )

To develop a unique solution to a problem, name aloud the new way you're looking at the challenge. Roll 2d6 + Expressive.

On a 10+, you successfully pioneer a breakthrough.
On a 7 to 9, you forge new ground, but it has limitations, only works short-term, or leads to unintended consequences.
On a 6-, your attempt to disrupt the known conventions fails and upsets powerful people.

### **Make A Statement** ( +Expressive )
