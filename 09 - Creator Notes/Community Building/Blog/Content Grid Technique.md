# Content Grid Technique

This is my method for thinking of infinite content ideas. This works for both longform content and social media posts. This is what I intend to use for discussing my TTRPG online.

## Content Pillars

The first thing you'll do is write a series of content pillars. These are not content types; Instead they're broad themes you want to touch on with your posts. So think of topics you could discuss quite a bit.

For example, with my TTRPG Starship Odyssey, the content pillars are 1) Solarpunk, 2) Science Fantasy, 3) Philosophy & Literature Influences, 4) Powered by the Apocalypse Mechanics, and 5) Starship Odyssey Lore itself. These are themes I could talk about endlessly without a lot of research or prompting. In fact, they are things I'm thinking about everyday, outside of writing content. So they are all excellent content pillars. 

I recommend 3 - 6 content pillars, but the higher range ( 5 - 6 ), gives you more flexibility.

Create a grid / table on anything: Google Sheets, Excel, or ol' reliable, a piece of printer paper. The content pillars will be the columns.

## Content Types

Next, you'll brainstorm types of content. For this, I'll provide a list that you can look for inspiration, because it's often difficult for people to think of ideas.
- Quotes from relevant resources
- Infographics & diagrams
- How-to guides & quick tips
- Explainer threads
- Glossary terms with definitions
- Links to resources including quick summary
- Open question to spark discussions
- Polls & surveys
- Community content
- Sneak peeks or behind-the-scenes
- Relevant memes & trends
- Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions
- Personal reflections
- Celebrations of milestones or achievements

Feel free to add any others you can think of! These will be your rows. 

## Content Grid

Now, for each pillar, look at the content type. These intersections allow you narrow down your post ideas. This way, instead of coming up with *something, anything*, you ask yourself or your team to brainstorm ideas about topics you are passionate about and with content you know you can create.

If you chose steampunk and explainer thread, you might explain the history of steampunk. If you're talking about open questions and space, you might ask "What's holding us back from xyz technology in the next 50 years?"

For each intersection, list a post idea. Some won't work as posts, and that's okay.

As an example, here is a partially complete content grid I made in Obsidian's canvas mode.
