# Introduction Skills-Based

My name is Chase and I use she / her pronouns! I'm 31 years old and based in Florida in the United States (UTC -5). I have a variety of experiences and would consider myself a bit of a tech generalist. Here's a list of my skills so we can see if we can work together!

I'm a game developer! I'm currently working on a TTRPG called *Starship Odyssey*. About video games, I also have a little bit of experience with Unity and Blender. Those might someday maybe be something I'll be willing to get back into for the right project. I'm also a pixel artist. I've created a few animated .pngTuber characters for myself and friends.

I have extensive experience writing in an academic context. In that area, I'm a former college-level writing tutor. Writing in a blogging / content marketing context is more engaging for me, though.

I have experience with web development, mostly React and Next.js, but other SSGs as well. I've also worked extensively with CMSs, mostly Ghost CMS, but also WordPress.

I also have pretty significant experience with content marketing, content management via CMSs, and social media management. I have worked for a local marketing agency (soul crushing), as well as been in many other positions where marketing was highly relevant to day-to-day operations. I also dabble in graphic design.

As a result of all of the above, I'm pretty experienced with both solo and team project / task management.

On other interests, I'm generally a big nerd. Solarpunk optimism is life. Neurodiversity and disability advocacy are important to me. Huge into Obsidian and git. I love FOSS and self-hosting.

Happy to help on TTRPGs and or solarpunk projects on a paid and or mutual aid basis.

My DMs are always open to respectful messages!
