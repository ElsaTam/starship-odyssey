## General

Hello all! I'm designing a tabletop RPG called *Starship Odyssey*, exploring a solarpunk starship floating through the vast unknown as humanity's final ark, all using by *Powered by the Apocalypse*-based mechanics.

Here's a quick elevator pitch:

> Embark aboard the *Starship Odyssey*, a gleaming, near-utopic starship-city serving as humanity's gleaming yet unexpected final ark. Within its sectors, you'll explore a vibrant solarpunk community rich in interspecies art, high-stakes diplomacy, and cosmic discovery. The diverse communities await your influence to tip the scales as tensions rise towards conflict. *Powered by the Apocalypse*-based mechanics encourage narrative choices and invite players to become magiartists, technomancers, and galactic ascetics. As members of a new cohort aboard the ship, you’ll uncover a tangled web of politics and celestial mysteries. Discover a personal identity on the *Odyssey*. Forge friendships across boundaries. Navigate faction alliances. Shape the future of humanity in ways only you can, as every decision echoes through the cosmos and determines the fate of all aboard.

I'd love to collaborate with creative writers, visual artists, graphic designers, playtesters, game designers, and more. If you're interested in being involved deeply with this project, especially if it scratches your solarpunk, combat light, narrative heavy, and or Powered by the Apocalypse itches, please message me for a link to my small, private Discord server.

For others, I'll be posting looking for creatives on a commission basis soon!

Thank you!

I'd love to find some playtesters! We already have some people interested in the mornings (EDT) on weekdays and evenings (EDT) on weekends.

If you're interested in being involved deeply with this project, especially if it scratches your solarpunk, combat light, narrative heavy, and or Powered by the Apocalypse itches, please message me for a link to my small, private Discord server.

I'd especially love to hear from people that are willing to playtest as a GM!

Thank you!
