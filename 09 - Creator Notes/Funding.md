# Funding

#needsRevision 

> [!info]+ **TLDR:**
> I want to publish my campaign setting / PbtA-inspired game system, Starship Odyssey, as a .pdf, but there are plenty of associated expenses. Instead of paying purely out of my pocket or starting a stressful Kickstarter campaign, I’m going to start a Patreon (or similar) and begin building a community around the project. Speculation, personal experiences, and comments on this plan all accepted and encouraged.

**Brief history**: I’d initially been planning on funding the publishing of Starship Odyssey with my personal money, putting it on DriveThruRPG as pay-what-you-want, and just taking it at a (huge) loss. Since I'm keeping it to a .pdf, the **expenses will be editing, art, and graphic design**. Paying for it with personal funds would mean that progress would be very slow going.

I'm **not planning on making any profit, just hoping to pay for related expenses and get people playing.**

I was briefly considering a Kickstarter, but I believe that **crowdfunding would require too much stress and time investment**. 

Instead, I'm going to **start a Patreon while Starship Odyssey is still under development**. This allows me to **make money, however small, to offset costs**. Even if the backers are *just* friends and family, it will be **motivating to know people are waiting on updates** (without being too pushy). It can also be a great way to **find playtesters and get feedback.**

I may be interested in **Patreon alternatives** where I have better control over my data, fewer platform fees, etc. Ghost CMS (oversimplication: a website manager like WordPress or Squarespace), which I have plenty of experience with, has really easy built in systems for paid memberships. I haven't used them before but it seems very straightforward.

When the project is pretty complete, I **might someday maybe pitch an indie publisher** for licensing or even co-development, but that's pretty far off and aspirational.

In the meantime, I'll **community-build slow and steady** on Reddit, network in TTRPG spaces, open a Discord server, find playtesters, and other community building efforts.

Again, I'm not looking to make a profit, just hoping to pay for some expenses and get people playing my game.

**Speculation, personal experiences, and general comments on my plan all accepted and encouraged.**
