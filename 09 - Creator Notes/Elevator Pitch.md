## Starship Odyssey Elevator Pitch

Embark aboard the *Starship Odyssey*, a gleaming, near-utopic starship-city serving as humanity's gleaming yet unexpected final ark. Within its sectors, you'll explore a vibrant solarpunk community rich in interspecies art, high-stakes diplomacy, and cosmic discovery. The diverse communities await your influence to tip the scales as tensions rise towards conflict. *Powered by the Apocalypse*-based mechanics encourage narrative choices and invite players to become magiartists, technomancers, and galactic ascetics. As members of a new cohort aboard the ship, youâ€™ll uncover a tangled web of politics and celestial mysteries. Discover a personal identity on the *Odyssey*. Forge friendships across boundaries. Navigate faction alliances. Shape the future of humanity in ways only you can, as every decision echoes through the cosmos and determines the fate of all aboard.
