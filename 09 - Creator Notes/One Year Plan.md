# One Year Plan

## Scope

By MegaCon next year, mid-March 2026, we'd like to have a 32-page primer published and available as both a .pdf and a print-on-demand softcover book through DriveThruRPG. It will be printed in standard colors, softcover, and 8.5" x 11". We are considering also crossposting the .pdf to itch.io.

The reason that we are aiming for 32 pages is that, according to [[PWYW & POD Advice from Kevin Crawford|PWYW & POD Advice from Kevin Crawford]], that's where the pricing for print-on-demand becomes reasonable.

These 32 pages will include material for both players and GMs. My current idea is have the primer as an in-universe document, at least the player section. In lore, this would be published by the *Starship Odyssey* and distributed off-ship to find people to join the cohort of new arrivals allowed every 5 years.

## Projects

Expected projects include:
- Designing mechanics and lore.
- Writing text explaining mechanics and lore.
- Editing the text for spelling, grammar, word choice, flow, clarity etc.
- Creating printable, B&W materials for players and GMs, such as character sheets, etc.
- Laying out of the pages of the book.
- Creating graphic design, such as the logo, promotional materials, small icons, etc.
- Creating small art, such as illustrations of the non-human races, busts of major NPCs, and other elements. I would like as few as an illustration every 3 pages, but more would be lovely within the limitations of the format.
- Creating the cover art. Must be very large. Will likely be either the exterior of the ship or a large interior scene.
- Promoting via social media (BlueSky, Mastodon, Reddit).
- Promoting via a blog website managed via Ghost CMS.

## Release & Playtesting Cycle

We will be doing extensive iteration in order to create the best game possible. We hope to progress in this way:
- Pre-Alpha Release
	- Initial play testing for specific mechanics
- Alpha Release
	- Comprehensive playtesting one-shot campaigns
- Beta Release
	- Playtesting longer ( 2 - 4 session ) campaigns
- Primer Publication
	- Promotional playtesting at MegaCon

## Pricing & Funding

Here is our planned pricing model:

| Item              | Listed Price | DTRPG's Cut | Printing Costs | Profit |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ------ |
| .pdf Only         | $4.99        | $1.75       | $0.00          | $3.24  |
| POD Only          | $11.99       | $4.20       | $3.83          | $3.96  |
| POD + .pdf Bundle | $12.49       | $4.37       | $3.83          | $4.29  |

This far from release, we have no way of knowing how many sales we will make.

In the meantime, here are some of the costs we predict:

| Item                                | Amount      | Cost  | Price      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Copyediting                         | 18000 words | $0.05 | $900       |
| Layout                              | 32 pages    | $9    | $288       |
| Graphic Design                      | 3 pieces    | $150  | $450       |
| Small Art                           | 8 pieces    | $100  | $800       |
| Cover Art                           | 1 piece     | $500  | $500       |
| Website Hosting & CMS               | 12 months   | $31   | $372       |
| Social Media Management ( Postpone) | 12 months   | $25   | $300       |
| Domain Name                         | 1 year      | $15   | $15        |
|                                     |             |       |            |
| Total                               |             |       | **$3,625** |

In order to pay for these expenses, we will be creating a paid membership (similar to a Patreon model) on our website.

Here are the planned tier and benefits:

**Stellar Voyager**
For **$5/month**, you get:
- Early access to playtest materials.
- Premium Discord server roles.

**Celestial Envoy**
For **$10/month**, you get:
- All of the above
- Priority for playtesting.
- Voting rights in polls for minor lore.
- Monthly exclusive in-universe written content.
- Monthly written one-page dev update.

**Quantum Shaper**
For **$15/month**, you get:
- All of the above
- Early access to art commissions.
- Personalized integration into the world.
- Quarterly detailed dev commentary logs.

Again, as our social media accounts and website are new, we aren't sure how many members we will attract.

## Future Projects

Beyond the one year, we will need to reassess our desires, budget, life situations, and so on. However, there are a few options to consider:
- Create a longer book for the base game
- Expand on the material with other mechanics or lore
- Pitch to an indie publisher
