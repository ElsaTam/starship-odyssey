## Agenda

The GM Agenda is what you aim to do every session

- **Make the characters' actions ripple through their communities,** leaving behind a legacy, not just simple outcomes.
- **Offer dilemmas without easy villains** where there are no 'right' answers and hard choices matter.
- **Uplift player creativity and collaboration,** letting their ideas shape the present and future of the *Odyssey*.
- **Show the ship as a living ecosystem** full of fragile beauty, interwoven systems, and clashing ideals.
- **Explore the true cost of violence,** not to shame or guilt players, but to deepen the emotional stakes.
- **Allow for redemption, restoration, and reconciliation for mistakes** but never without effort.
