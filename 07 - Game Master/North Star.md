> The core theme of the Starship Odyssey setting is the eternal struggle between the forces that support the Apollonian, representing order, structure, stability, and those that embrace the Dionysian, representing chaos, exploration, and creativity.
> 
> Tension between these two principles shape the ship’s politics, cultures, and existential dilemmas. This conflict is personified at every level of the setting: the universe’s broad narratives, smaller faction conflicts, interspecies clashes, and even the individual character arcs. Some organizations very clearly project the ideal they value, while others struggle with internal conflicts between the forces.

Or will they encourage the crew to take risks, as what is the world without creativity in both life and art?
