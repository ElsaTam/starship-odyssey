# The Development of the Starship

#needsWriting 

- The starship is shaped and structured like a brain
- At the core is something, some sort of old technology of the type that caused the [[Quantum Cascade]]. 
	- What tech?
	- How is it used now?
	- How was it involved with the QC?
	- Can it be used now? If so, what would happen?
- The company building the starship used time dilation (and nanobots) to speed up construction because they knew the QC was coming.
	- What impact did this have on the QC itself?
