# Basic History

NEEDS REVISION  

NEEDS MORE DETAIL

## Departure and Earth's Final Hours

52 years ago, the Starship Odyssey departed Earth under life-or-death circumstances. Envisioned as an ambitious, long-term interspecies experiment, the threat of the Quantum Cascade sped up construction by necessity. Reckless experiments by Earth's most powerful governments triggered this phenomenon. In the end, it caused reality fractures, rendering Earth uninhabitable within a year.

From the outset, the Odyssey hosted many alien species, including [[Oltori]], [[Gelarites]], [[Zypherians]], [[Voraxoids]], and [[Ethereons]]. Each species brought their unique perspectives, skills, and cultural practices. The multinational, multi-species scientific body overseeing the project, the [[Atlas Council]], used temporal manipulation tools provided by the [[Hephaestus Forge]] to speed up the completion of the ship.

In their last days on the planet, while quantum fractures were already tearing cities apart, a daring and unauthorized rescue mission by members of the [[Chronos Archives]] retrieved many significant Earth artifacts, preserving humanity's rich heritage on board.

## The Odyssey’s Journey So Far

In the 3rd terran year, the discovery and widespread recreational use of [[Lotus]], a psychoactive substance found on an uncharted asteroid, caused temporary chaos. This led to deepening cultural divisions aboard the ship.

Viktor "Clockwork" Voltaire and his [[Temporal Thieves]] infiltrated the Chronos Archives during a temporal rift in year 8. While the Safety & Security Team foiled this plot, many worry about the safety of the ship if (and when) similar attempts are made.

I dunno, something. between year 8 - year 28 maybe nooooo problems

Upon reaching the vast territory of the [[Interspecies Committee]] (ISC) in year 28, the humans aboard the Odyssey, as final representatives of their species, were granted probationary membership. This remains contingent upon adherence to the ISC’s principles and standardization of human cultural practices.

ISC mandates caused deep ideological rifts within the [[Muses' Collective]], who were instructed to portray only the positive aspects of human experience. In year 30, this prompted the formation of a splinter group called [[Artisans of Nyx]], who vowed to portray the full complexities of human nature.

A controversial quantum experiment by the Hephaestus Forge triggered a catastrophic temporal anomaly in year 36, briefly jeopardizing the entire ship. Public outcry forced the Atlas Council to put in place stricter oversight and regulatory measures.

In year 42, diplomatic tensions arose when provocative works by the Artisans of Nyx sparked offense among visiting representatives from the ISC. The [[Hermes Envoys]]’ skillful diplomacy mitigated potential fallout, reinforcing debates over artistic freedom versus diplomatic prudence.

The Atlas Council caught the Plutus Consortium attempting to sell protected Earth artifacts in year 46. An investigation by the Chronos Archives unveiled systemic corruption, resulting in sweeping reforms the following year.

A minor but passionate campaign advocating Voraxoid individuality rights challenged traditional hive-minded customs, highlighting deep philosophical debates about individuality versus community aboard the Odyssey.

## Current Status (Year 52)

As the Odyssey navigates ISC space under probation, it stands at a crossroads. The crew continues to grapple with cultural tensions, ethical dilemmas, and the consequences of their collective history. The delicate balance between technological advancement, artistic expression, diplomatic sensitivity, and cultural integrity shapes their ongoing journey.
